			<h2>Syllabus</h2>
			

			<p><b>Course:</b>&nbsp; Math 3C 
			(<a href="http://www.ucsd.edu/catalog/courses/MATH.html#math3c">Catalog Description</a>) 
			is the preparatory course for Math 10A (Calculus). 
			 &nbsp; </p>
			
			<p>
			<b>Attendance: </b>Unlike some courses, attendance is required for all lectures, 4th hours, and discussion sections.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>4th hour:</b> The 4th hour is used as an additional lecture, since the course syllabus cannot reasonably be covered using only the scheduled lecture hours.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Questions via Piazza</b> I will not answer mathematical or basic logistical questions via email. Instead I will redirect you to submit your
			question on Piazza. If you have not yet signed up, you can sign up 
			<a href="http://www.piazza.com/ucsd/fall2014/math3c">here</a>.
			If you have signed up, you can access the Piazza course webpage <a href="http://www.piazza.com/ucsd/fall2014/math3c/home">here</a>.
			Once you post your question, it will be either answered by another student, a TA, or by me (I may not get to it for 24 hours).
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Textbook:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Algebra & Trigonometry</i> (1st Edition), by Sheldon Axler; published by Wiley 2011.
			</p>

			<p>
			<b>Calculators:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Graphing calculators 
			are recommended (but not required) 
			for use in class and for homework.
			<b><i>Note: The use of calculators will not 
			be permitted during the midterms or the final exam.</i></b>
			<br><br>
			Help with using TI graphing calculators will be available in 
			the <a href="http://www.math.ucsd.edu/resources/tutoring/">Calculus 
			Tutoring Lab</a>. 
			</p>
			

			<p>
			<b>Reading:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Reading the sections of the textbook corresponding to the assigned homework exercises is considered part of the homework assignment; you are responsible for material in the assigned reading <i>whether or not it is discussed in the lecture.</i>
			</p>

			<p>
			<b>Homework:</b> &nbsp;&nbsp; Homework will be assigned on the course 
			<a href="homework.html">homework page</a> and must be 
			completed by the indicated due date. Any changes 
			to the assignments will be announced in class 
			and in the announcements section on the main page 
			of the course web site. <b>Late assignments will not be accepted</b>; 
			however, the lowest homework score will be dropped. 
			Selected problems on the assignment will be graded. 
			While your work will be graded for correctness, keep in mind 
			that presentation and organization directly affect your grader. 
			To assist your grader, you should keep all problems in the same 
			order as the assignment list and ordered vertically on your page. 
			If a problem is omitted, it should still appear in the correct order. 
			All work must be on full-sized notebook paper and all pages must 
			be stapled together. <b>Write your name (last name first), 
			your Discussion Section (A01, A02, etc.), and the homework 
			assignment number in the upper right corner.</b> 
			Homework will be returned in section the following week. 
			Watching someone else do a problem or "understanding" the 
			solution in a Solutions Manual does not indicate 
			mastery - you must be able to begin a solution on 
			your own and carry it to completion without help 
			before you can claim mastery of that problem. 
			Ask questions during office hours about homework 
			problems that have caused you difficulty and 
			indicate what attempts you have made to solve the problems. 
			A thorough understanding of the homework problems and their 
			solutions will prepare you well for the midterm exams and the final exam.
			</p>
			
			

			<p>
			<b>Midterm Exams:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; There will be two midterm exams during the quarter. There will be no makeup exams. &nbsp; (See the course <a href="calendar.html">calendar</a> for the specific dates.)
			</p>

			<p>
			<b>Final Exam:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; It is your responsibility to ensure that you do not have a schedule conflict involving the final examination; you should not enroll in this class if you cannot sit for the final examination at its scheduled time.
			</p>

			<p><b>Grading:</b> Your course grade will be determined by your cumulative average at the end of the term; your cumulative average will be the best of the following two weighted averages:

			<ul class="b">
			    <li><b>Method 1:</b> &nbsp; 20% Homework, 20% Midterm Exam I, 20% Midterm Exam II, 40% Final Exam</li>
			    <li><b>Method 2:</b> &nbsp; 20% Homework, 20% Best Midterm, 60% Final Exam</li>
			</ul>
			<br>			
			Since there are no makeup exams, if you miss the midterm exam for any reason then your course grade will be computed using Method 2.
			</p>


			<p>
			Letter grades will be determined by the following scale.
			<center>        
			<table class="grades" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
			<tbody>
			<tr>
			<td><b>A+</b></td>
			<td><b>A</b></td>
			<td><b>A-</b></td>
			<td><b>B+</b></td>
			<td><b>B</b></td>
			<td><b>B-</b></td>
			<td><b>C+</b></td>
			<td><b>C</b></td>
			<td><b>C-</b></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			<td><b>97</b></td>
			<td><b>93</b></td>
			<td><b>90</b></td>
			<td><b>87</b></td>
			<td><b>83</b></td>
			<td><b>80</b></td>
			<td><b>77</b></td>
			<td><b>73</b></td>
			<td><b>70</b></td>
			</tr>
			</tbody>
			</table>
			</center>

			<br>

			We may adjust the scale to be more lenient, but we guarantee that the grade corresponding to a given percentage will not be lower than specified by the above scale. <b>There will be no curve.</b>
			</p>
			
			<a name="prelectures"></a><p><b>Bonus points <a href="prelectures.html">(pre-lectures)<a>:</b> As an incentive to prepare yourself
			for the following lecture, I will post pre-lectures for you to optionally complete. Unlike the homework, these are intended for you to work completely 
			individually to encourage you to think about math on your own. They will be picked up
			at the beginning of lecture within the first 5 minutes of class. <del>I will assign a warm up problem in these lectures during which I will
			collect them</del> I will ask you to bring them to the front at the beginning of these lectures. Similarly to the homework:<b>Write your name (last name first), 
			your Discussion Section (A01, A02, etc.), and the pre-lecture number in the upper right corner.</b>There will be 12 pre-lectures total and I will be grading them 
			based solely on effort and thought (not correctness). If I suspect they were copied or done haphazardly, they will not count.
			They will affect your final grade in the following way:
			<br>
			<center>        
			<table class="prelectures" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
			<tr><td>All 12 completed:</td><td align="left"> +2.5 points</td></tr>
			<tr><td>At least 10 completed:</td><td align="left"> +2 points</td></tr>
			<tr><td>At least 8 completed:</td><td align="left"> +1.5 points</td></tr>
			<tr><td>At least 4 completed: </td><td align="left">+1 point</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Less than 4 completed: </td><td align="left">+0 points</td></tr>
		
			</table>
			</center>
			<p><b>Regrades:</b> &nbsp;All graded materials will be returned in 
the discussion sections.&nbsp; If
you find a grading or point totalling error on any graded material, <i>you 
must return 
it immediately to your TA</i>.&nbsp; 
Regrade requests will not be considered once the graded material leaves 
the room.&nbsp; If you do 
not retrieve your graded materials during discussion section, you
must arrange to pick them up from your TA within one week after they were 
returned
in order for any regrade request to be considered.</p>


<p><b>Grade Recording Errors</b>: &nbsp;Keep all of your graded 
materials and check TED to make 
sure that the grades on your papers are the same as the grades recorded on 
TED.&nbsp; If there is any 
mistake in the recording of your 
scores, you must bring us the original graded materials in order for us to 
make a 
change.</p>

			<p><b>Academic Dishonesty:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Academic dishonesty is considered a serious offense at UCSD.&nbsp;  Students caught cheating will face an administrative sanction which may include suspension or expulsion from the university.&nbsp; It is in your best interest to maintain your academic integrity. (<a href="http://students.ucsd.edu/academics/academic-integrity/">Click here</a> for more information.)</p>
